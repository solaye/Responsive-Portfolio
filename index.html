         <p>My name is Stetson Olaye, and I am from the greatest state in the Union. The Lone Star State of Texas.
            I am 30 years old and currently based out of Denver, CO where I have resided the past five years. </p>


         <p>I have a 2-year-old German Shepherd named Lennon after John Lennon. I love basketball, hiking,
            snowboarding, watching anime, movies, and reruns of Seinfeld.
            I never met a taco that I didn't like, and could probably say the same thing about beer.
            I am hoping to become awesome at coding throughout the six months of the program so that I can realize my
            dreams of world domination (evil laugh). </p>
